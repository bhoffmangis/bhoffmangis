- 👋 Hi, I’m Brandon!
- 👀 I’m primarily a GIS guy but I've always been really geeked about learning programming. I started out with C++ and eventually gravitated towards Visual C# as there was something very satisfying about being able to fairly painlessly create a Windows form app that I could use immediately. Since I'm into GIS, Python and SQL are a pretty big focus these days as well. I'm still very much a newb though but hopefully I'll get good enough to be useful one day!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning/practicing fundamentals stuff. Whether it's C++, C#, Python, or whatever, I understand that the fundamentals are the same regardless of the language used. That said, I'm really trying to make sure that I understand concepts that apply everywhere (control flow, data structures, etc.).
- 💞️ Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read!.
